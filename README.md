# Creating a Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline


In this project, we're going to be using a Docker installation of Jenkins to build a top-to-bottom CI/CD DevOps Pipeline.


# Setup


Step 1: Installing Docker Desktop

Step 2: Install Jenkins using Docker Compose (https://github.com/vdespa/install-jenkins-docker)
 - Note: Need to cd to "install-jenkins-docker" folder.
    - Use "docker compose up -d" to start.
    - Use "docker compose down" to stop Jenkins.
    - Access portal at http://localhost:8080/
